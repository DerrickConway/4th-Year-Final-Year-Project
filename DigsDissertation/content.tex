\chapter{Introduction}

When choosing our project we wanted to pick something that was relevant to current everyday life. We wanted a project that also highlighted our skills and allowed us to learn and develop as part of a team. With this criteria in mind we started brain storming ideas for our project.

We eventually decided on a App called Digs. Digs would be a Student Accommodation app. We recognized the current accommodation crisis throughout Ireland and thought it would benefit students and landlords to have a specific letting app for the student population. Also for students it was quiet disheartening to apply for accommodation and be rejected for being of student status. This is quiet common when renting and with our app they would only be applying for lettings specific to them.

Having a student accommodation app as our starting point we started to research other apps and websites in the accommodation letting/renting category. The main one we focused on was the Daft App\cite{Daft}. Daft would be the most popular accommodation app in Ireland and it provided us with a great deal of insight on what our app would need to have and also on what Daft lacks for the student market. 

We wanted a app that had essentially the same functionality as Daft but which was geared more towards student. We did this by focusing on the college campuses and not specific cities. We also created a forum for students to get in touch with one another, to either get a house together or to get someone for a room in the house they are already renting. These would compliment the normal functionality of a accommodation app such as, publish ads (either rooms or properties), search lists (rooms or properties), view rooms and properties and edit and delete your personal ads. This would also require log in and registration functionality.

After deliberating over the objective of our application, we then turned to what technology we would use. We wanted to use a array of technologies to show our capabilities but also gain more knowledge and become better programmers over all. We settled on a 3 tier structure containing a Ionic 3 presentation tier(front end), NodeJs logic tier(middleware)  and Mongo/firebase database data tier(back end).

From what we hoped to achieve from creating this app was the knowledge of new technology, personal growth through team building and of course to produce something of substance and something we could be proud of.

\chapter{Context}
The general context of our application resolves around students having a platform which is geared towards finding accommodation. Students will be able to search through available listings, advertise their own rooms for rent and allows letters to advertise full properties to students. Listings can be created by advertising a room or property, with a series of criteria. Some examples of criteria would be proximity to College campus, room/property type, location, price, contact information and a description. Along with this information, images can be taken with the user’s device camera or uploaded directly from their device which is then linked with that listing. Students looking for accommodation can also search through available listings based on the following criteria: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item Price
  \item Which college campuses are close
  \item Room/Property Type
  \item Parking Availability
\end{itemize}

\section{Objectives}
The main objective of our application is to help students who may be struggling with the current accommodation crisis in Ireland. We also wanted to make it easier for students and landlords, who are looking to rent or let. The following is a list of the main pages in our application along with the objectives for each page. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Login/Register Page} Our application has a login and a register page. The following are the objectives for these pages. The register page allows the user to securely register with our application while the login page allows the user to securely login to our application. Once logged in the user has access to extra features not accessible to unregistered users. 
    
    \item \textbf{Forgot-Password Page}
    The objective of the forgot-password page is to allow a user who has forgotten their password to enter their email address. They will then receive an email containing a link which will allow them to create a new password.

    \item \textbf{Home Page} 
    The objective of the homepage is that it is a base of navigation for the application. It displays the total number of both properties and rooms that are currently listed. The homepage will also display if a user is logged in or not.
    
    \item \textbf{List of Rooms/Properties Page} 
    The objective of both these pages is to display all the currently listed rooms and properties to the user. Showing the main criteria on each room/property so the user can make an informed decision.
    
    \item \textbf{Create a Room/Property Page} 
    The objective of both these pages is to allow the user to create a room or property listing and then publish it. This will allow the user to showcase their room/property using images, filling in form details and their own personal description.
    
    \item \textbf{Message Board} 
    The objective of the message board is to have a place where students can communicate with each other, helping themselves find other students that are looking for accommodation
    
    \item \textbf{Search} 
    The objective of the search page is to allow students to refine the number of listings based upon criteria they specify. 
    
    \item \textbf{My Ads Page}
    The objective of the My Ad’s page is to allow a user to view a list of their published ads. In here they can delete these ads or they have the option to edit their published ads.

\section{Development Environment}

\subsection{GitHub}
GitHub hosting project on the Internet. It can be used freely for Open Source projects. Now GitHub is the most popular hosting service for developers. It uses the Git version control system, hence the name GitHub.\par

The project is hosted on GitHub and is called a repository. Anyone can subscribe to an account on GitHub and create their own repositories. GitHub users can add other users to their project to work together.\par

GitHub users have access to other open source projects this enables them to work on it themselves. Developers use this function to send patches and make their own code for other open source projects.\par 

In addition to being just a hosting project, GitHub is also a great social networking site for developers and programmers. It allows users to follow each other, subscribes to project updates, like them, giving them an assessment, etc. These functions allow users to receive updates for projects in which they are interested, or stay in touch with colleagues and employees.\par

GitHub is not only used for programming and software development. It is also used by many other types of projects. For example, open source tutorials, documentation projects, training resources and other projects in which users can work together.\cite{GitHub}\par

Some sample examples of git commands:
\begin{itemize}

    \item git add .\par
    Adds all modified and untracked files in the current directory
    
    \item git commit -m "Commit message"\par
    To commit changes.
    
    \item git push origin master\par
    To send changes to repository. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ionic}
Ionic is a framework with a stunningly designed graphical interface, styled for various platforms, for maximum similarity to native applications. AngularJS and sass are taken as a basis for the framework, AngularJS and sass are taken, which brought him great popularity among developers, as these technologies reduce the threshold of entry to a minimum. The core of the framework is Cordoba, so all the plugins of Cordoba will work fine on ionic.\par In addition to the platform and ready-made UI components, Ionic has a thoughtful command line interface that allows you o generate icons, splash screens, run the file in the browser with the app for debugging, and build applications with short commands in the console.\par Also worth noting is the detailed documentation with examples.\cite{Ionic}

\subsubsection{Ionic UI}
Ionic has dozens of ready-made components, which are constantly being refined and replenished with new ones. You can fully read them on the documentation page.\cite{IonicUI}

\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{OS oriented styles}
Ionic is not just a good interface, it is adapted to the specifics of various operating systems and is thought through to the smallest detail. Animations, icons, fonts, all this with the same code will look like the operating system under which the application is built (Android or iOS, and starting with the second version and Windows Phone).\cite{IonicOS}

\subsection{Visual Studio Code}

A sample of the MongoDB stucture is as follows\cite{WilliamZola}:
\begin{minted}{json}
{
    "_id" : 1

\end{minted}

\section{NoSQL database}
The ascent of Big Data made an interest for on a horizontally adaptable Data Management System. This prompted advancement of various types of Database Management System which all things considered go under NoSQL. NoSQL Databases are comprehensively separated into following sorts: Document, Key-value, Graph, Native object, Table type, Native XML and Hybrid Databases. All RDBMS databases depend on the same model, while, each of the NoSQL database takes after a distinctive model. NoSQL moves far from the robust institutionalized type of SQL database and empowers less complex information capacity arrangements. Therefore a NoSQL database is enhanced for the particular application.\cite{noSql}

\subsection{NoSql database types}

\begin{itemize}
\item Key-Value Storage \par
Key-Value Storages are straight forward and simple NoSQL frameworks, for example, Redis that are fundamentally a truly favour hash table. You have an esteem you need to get later, so you allocate it a key and in addition stuff it into the database, you can just inquiry a single object at any given moment and just by a single key.

\item Document Storage \par
Regularly, these are objects with a various levelled structure, for example, XML documents, JSON records, and some other kind of tree structure, yet the qualities of various nodes on the tree can be indexed. They have a much speed with respect to customary push construct SQL databases in light of query in light of the fact that they give up execution on joining. 

\item Columnar Storage  \par
These store the information in columns instead of lines, so refreshing and adding are costly, be that as it may, most questions are modest in light of the fact that each segment is basically certainly recorded. In any case, on the off chance that your inquiry can not utilize an index, you are in no better shape with a Columnar Store rather than a standard SQL database.

\item Graph Storage  \par
Diagram Databases (neo4j) make joins as shoddy as could be expected under the circumstances, on the grounds that even a straightforward row query would require many joins to recover. Tables can sort query would be slower than a standard SQL database in view of the greater part of the additional joins to retrieve the information. \cite{DataTypes}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Advantages of NoSql}
NoSQL databases are very versatile, dependable, have a basic data model, amazingly exposed query language, no system for taking care of consistency and trustworthiness among data, and no help for security at the database level. A standout amongst the most vital points of interest of NoSQL databases is that the databases can handle unstructured information. Unstructured data can be word reports, messages, sound, video, or even interpersonal social network information. Too, NoSQL databases tend to scale extremely well on commodity equipment. Some even claim that NoSQL databases empower better execution, which is urgent for organizations with a lot of data. To empower quicker execution, NoSQL databases ordinarily don't cling to ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) restrictions that are utilized as a part of relational databases. While this is recorded as a star for NoSQL as far as execution and processing time; we take note of that this likewise has unfortunate outcomes that will be tended to later. A case of NoSQL database's execution is Facebook's usage (Cassandra) that is equipped for dealing with more than 100 million clients persistently. \cite{AdvantagesnoSql}

\subsection{Examples of NoSQL}
\begin{itemize}
\item Key-Value Storage: \par
MUMPS, CouchDB, FoundationDB, Redis, Aerospike, Dynamo, MemcacheDB, Riak, OrientDB, Fair Com c-treeACE, Redis.

\item Apache CouchDB, MarkLogic, OrientDB, Clusterpoint, Couchbase, MongoDB.

\item Columnar Storage:  \par
Vertica, Cassandra, Hbase, Accumulo, Druid.

\item Graph Storage:  \par
Neo4J, OrientDB, Stardog, Allegro, InfiniteGraph, Virtuoso.

\section{JQuery}

\section{JavaScript}
Javascript is a programming language with which web pages are given interactivity. It creates applications that are included in the HTML-code (for example, questionnaires or registration forms that are filled in by the user).\par The uniqueness of this programming language is that it is supported by almost all browsers and fully integrated with them, and all that can be done with it is done very simply. No other technology accommodates all these advantages together. To date, this technology is actively developing also developing a programming language Javascript2 \cite{JavaScript}

\begin{minted}{js}
// add two numbers
<script>
    var num1, num2, sum
    num1 = prompt("Enter first number")
    num2 = prompt("Enter second number")
    sum = parseInt(num1) + parseInt(num2) // "+" means "add"
    alert("Sum = " + sum)  // "+" means combine into a string
</script>
\end{minted}
\cite{JavaScriptCode}

\section{CSS}
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) - cascading style sheets. In fact, they serve to separate the page structure and its content from its appearance.\par If the page is completely written in HTML, then each element of the code determines not only the content element of the page but also its way of displaying. For example, not only that there is a text "Hello" in such and such a place, but also that this text is highlighted in bold and red.\par With the use of CSS code, everything happens a little differently. With the help of HTML, only the order of the content elements of the page and their classes are described. The corresponding classes are written in the CSS file. Each of them is assigned a set of properties. Now, when we assign a class to an HTML element, then all the properties of this class are applied to it. Do not write all these properties every time. Now, when sites have many pages, you can not do without CSS. \cite{CSS}

body {
  font-family: Verdana, 
  Arial, sans-serif;
  }
