# Introduction<a name = "intro"></a>
For our final year project we decided to create an Accommodation App called Digs  specifically for students. Currently there is a  accommodations  crisis across Ireland and we felt an App like ours was badly needed.  Working as a team and following an agile methodology we developed an App that allows users to view accommodation ads and post accommodation listings on our app.  Adding specific features such as, adding college as a search criteria and creating a message board for student to group together and find accommodation gears our app specifically for student.  We created a 3 tier application,using Mongo Db and Firebase as the our Data Tier, NodeJS for our LogicTier and Ionic 3 for our Presentation Tier.
